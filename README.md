# Exercises from Learn Haskell by building a blog generator

This is a documentation of the code I wrote when working my way through [this free e-book that is available online](https://learn-haskell.blog/). There's a lot Haskell resources that are either theoretical or abstract. I chose this book out of many other options because:

* it's relatively short
* it's very practical
* I'll use the code for my own website
* I'll learn surface level Haskell
